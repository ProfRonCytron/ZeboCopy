\begin{frame}{Overview}{What will we study here?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Phase has been an elusive aspect of quantum state.
    \item As we have studied, the probability of a measurement outcomes is related to the amplitude of the coefficient present the associated basis state.
    \item We use phase during a quantum computation to establish interference patterns of interest.
    \item While we cannot directly measure phase, we can estimate a constant phase shift between basis states in a superposition.
    \item The study of this material leads directly to quantum Fourier analysis, which in turn is the basis of Shor's famous algorithm.
\end{itemize}
