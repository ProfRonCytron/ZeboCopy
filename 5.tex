\begin{frame}{Orthogonality}{A set of mutually exclusive outcomes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A quantum computing system contains elements, such as electrons, ions, or photons, whose quantum behavior can be influenced to achieve computation.
    \item When measured, each quantum element will be in one of a mutually orthogonal set of $d$~states.
    
\end{itemize}
\OnlyRemark{2}{In a physical system, the outcomes will be physically exclusive, so that only one of the~$d$ outcomes can ever occur.

Mathematically, we will model that behavior using orthogonal basis vectors.}
