\begin{frame}{Overview}{What will we study?}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item We will look at a sequence of problems, their classical solutions, and their quantum solutions.
    \item We study the phase-kickback trick, which is used for many of the algorithms of interest.
    \item Each successive problem is harder for a classical computer to solve.
    \item We study a general technique for unstructured search, Grover's algorithm.
    \item We learn how to use quantum computers to find the period of a function.
    \item We learn how to compute the Quantum Fourier Transform.
    \item We finish with Shor's famous algorithm for factoring numbers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{An important note}{Concerning proofs of quantum algorithms' correctness}

\begin{itemize}
    \item With some classical algorithms, you may be convinced of the algorithm's correctness simply from the code of the algorithm.
    \item You have probably nonetheless been required to write proofs of such algorithms.
    \item With quantum algorithms, it is the properties of a quantum circuit that yield desired results.
    \item It is unlikely that we can understand those properties by inspection.
    \item Proofs by way of the state analysis of circuits are required to understand how and why a given algorithm produces its results.
\end{itemize}
