\begin{frame}{Introduction}{The CHSH game}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Alice and Bob are initially proximate, so that they can strategize.\footnote{They could make some EPR pairs, but that comes later!}
        \item They then separate by a large distance.
        \item A referee randomly and uniformly sends one of two words to Alice, and one of two other words to Bob.  It is expedient to use colors for the words:
        \begin{description}
            \item[Alice] will hear \RD{red} or \YL{yellow}.
            \item[Bob] will hear \GN{green} or \OR{orange}.
        \end{description}
    \item Alice and Bob each respond with one bit ($0$ or $1$).  To win$\ldots$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If Alice and Bob hear \RD{red} and \GN{green}, respectively, their bits must differ.
        \item Otherwise, their bits must agree.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Alice and Bob are too far apart to communicate before their answer is needed.
    \item What is the best they can do?
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Classical strategies}{How well can they do?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Based on the information given to Alice, she has only four possible strategies:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Always respond $0$
        \item Always respond $1$
        \item Use the colors:  \RD{$0$}, \YL{$1$}
        \item Or oppositely:  \YL{$0$}, \RD{$1$}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Bob has the same four strategies, so between them they have~16 strategies.
    \item The simplest strategy is that they always respond with the same bit, say $0$.
    \item They will win $\frac{3}{4}$ of the games they play, which turns out to be the best they can do classically.
\end{itemize}
