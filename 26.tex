\begin{frame}{Overview}{What do we study here?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Some search problems have \emph{structure}, which can lead to efficient methods of solving the search problem.
    \item For example, a sorted array of integers can be subject to binary search, discovering whether an integer is present in $\Theta(\log{N})$ time for an array of size~$N$.
    \item An \emph{unstructured} search problem has no such advantage.  Classically, we may have to examine each of the $N$ items in a collection to find an object of interest.
    \item Any problem in \href{https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:N\#np}{\CompClass{NP}} can be posed as unstructured search problem.
\end{itemize}

    \item We know how to create the superposition of all inputs.
    \item Our oracle implements $f(x)$ so that its value, computed in polynomial time, is
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[0] if $x$ is not a solution to our problem
      \item[1] if $x$ is a solution to our problem
    \end{itemize}
    \item Our unstructured search problem is to find $x\ |\ f(x)=1$.
    \item Due to phase kickback, the output of the top~$n$ qubits is the superposition of all $f(x)$, each with sign $(-1)^{f(x)}$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider two large primes $p$ and $q$ whose products are $r$.
    \item Let $x$ have $n$ qubits, sufficient to encode $p$ and $q$: \[n=\Theta(\log{p}+\log{q})=\Theta(\log{pq})\]
    \item Given an input $x=pq$, our oracle returns $1$ if  $p\times q=r$. Otherwise, $0$ is returned.
