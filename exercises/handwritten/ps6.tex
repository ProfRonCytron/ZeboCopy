\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries]

    \item Note: Phase kickback, oracle, Deutsch questions, Deutsch Josza questions
    \item Analyze bottom qubit in Lecture 21, slide 13. (Will add better explanation)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What would measuring the qubit directly in each case yield?
        \item If the bottom qubit was run through a Hadamard gate, what would measuring the qubit in each case yield?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Consider the phase kickback trick studied in Lecture 22. Suppose the input for $y = \ket{+}$. Explain why the phase kickback trick no longer works by analysing the circuit in terms of the Deutsch problem as well as more generally.
    \item D-J problem, k-balanced f analysis
    
\end{enumerate}
