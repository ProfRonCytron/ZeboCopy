\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries]
    \item Give the unitary matrix that describes the below circuit. Note the second gate is the controlled Z gate. Is the state at the end of this circuit entangled? Why or why not?
    \[\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{cz-gate}\]
    \item Can the controlled Z gate matrix be written as the tensor product of two matrices? Prove or disprove.
    \item Consider the controlled U gate.
    \[\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & e^{i\gamma}\cos{\frac{\theta}{2}} & 0 &  -e^{i(\gamma+\lambda)}\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}\\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & e^{i(\gamma+\phi)}\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}} & 0 &  e^{i(\gamma+\phi+\lambda)}\cos{\frac{\theta}{2}}\\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \]
    For what values of $\gamma,\phi,\lambda,$ and $\theta$ can we use the controlled U gate to cause entanglement?
    \item Consider standard quantum teleportation (Lecture 10). Imagine Alice has the incredible power to transmit exactly one bit to Bob instantaneously (faster than the speed of light whoa). Let's think about how this changes Bob's situation.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the probability that Bob obtains the correct state?
        \item What does Bob know about his state if Alice tells him the first qubit's value of her system?
        \item What does Bob know about his state if Alice tells him the second qubit's value of her system?
        \item If Bob only cares about getting the probabilities of his basis states right and doesn't care about the phase of his system, which qubit would he want Alice to send?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Prove that using just a single EPR pair, Bob cannot obtain Alice's state any better than 50\% of the time without communication and ignoring phase differences.
    \item Consider the entangled state: 
    \[\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00}+\ket{11})\]
    Show that applying a general U gate to the first qubit still results in an entangled state.
    \item What is the relationship between the factorability of a 2 qubit gate and that same gate's ability to cause entanglement? (I'm not sure)
    \item Recreate the table on slide 9 in Lecture 10 (I.e. what action Bob should take for each measurement Alice could observe) if Alice and Bob used the below EPR pair to accomplish quantum teleporation.
    \[\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{01}-\ket{10})\]
    \item Partial measurement question? Just easy math question of renormalizing
    
\end{enumerate}
