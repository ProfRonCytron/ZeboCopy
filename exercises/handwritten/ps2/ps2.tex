\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries]
    \item (20 points) Given $\ket{\psi} = \alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1}$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the state of $\ket{\psi_0} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{Y}\mathbf{Z}\ket{\psi}$? Give the statevector and show how you arrived at your answer. \LeaveSpace[0.4in]
        \item Describe the above operation as rotations on the Bloch sphere.\LeaveSpace{}
        \item What is the state of $\ket{\psi_1} = \mathbf{Z}\mathbf{Y}\mathbf{X}\ket{\psi}$? Give the statevector and show how you arrived at your answer. \LeaveSpace[0.4in]
        \item Does $\ket{\psi_0} = \ket{\psi_1}$? \Blank{}
        \item Is the probability of measuring $\ket{0}$ when we measure $\ket{\psi_0}$ equal to the probability of measuring $\ket{0}$ when we measure $\ket{\psi_1}$? Why or why not?\LeaveSpace{}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item (8 points) Give a unitary matrix $U$ that when we apply the operation $\mathbf{Y}U\ket{0}$ results in a $\frac{3}{4}$ chance of measuring $\ket{1}$. Show how you found $U$. \LeaveSpace[2.0in]
    \item (4 points) Consider $\ket{\psi} = \mathbf{X}^a\mathbf{Y}^b\mathbf{Z}^c\ket{0}$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $a,c$ are even and $b$ is odd, what is the probability of observing $\ket{0}$ when we measure $\ket{\psi}$? \Blank{}
        \item If $a,b,c$ are all even what is the probability of observing $\ket{1}$ when we measure $\ket{\psi}$? \Blank{}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item (5 points) If we begin at $\ket{0}$ on the Bloch sphere and can use any of the Pauli gates, how many unique (under rotation by the $\mathbf{Z}$ gate) locations can we travel to on the Bloch sphere? Explain your answer. \LeaveSpace{}
    \item (5 points) If we now also allow the use of the Hadamard gate, how many unique (under rotation by the $\mathbf{Z}$ gate) locations can we travel to on the Bloch sphere? Explain your answer. \LeaveSpace{}
    \item (20 points) Recall two points on the Bloch sphere are antipodal if they determine a line that passes through the center of the sphere. Recall that in polar coordinates, a quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ can be specified on the Bloch sphere using two coordinates, $\theta$ and $\phi$:
    \[\ket{\psi} = \cos(\frac{\theta}{2})\ket{0}
    + e^{i\phi}\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})\ket{1}\]
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item All points on the Bloch sphere denote unique (under rotation by the $\mathbf{Z}$ gate) quantum states except which two points? \Blank{} and\Blank{}
        \item The number of quantum states on the Bloch sphere is \emph{countably} infinite or \emph{uncountably} infinite? \Blank{}
        \item Given a state $\ket{\psi}$ defined as above, define its antipodal state $\ket{\psi'}$. \LeaveSpace{}
        \item Prove that $\ket{\psi}$ and $\ket{\psi'}$ are orthogonal by showing their inner product is 0. \LeaveSpace[2.0in]
    \end{enumerate}
    \item (5 points) Your friend, Albert Einstein, has challenged you to a quantum game. The game is played as follows: First, Einstein gives you some state $\ket{\psi}$ and tells you where it is located on the Bloch sphere by telling you $\theta$ and $\phi$. You then can apply any quantum gates you wish to $\ket{\psi}$. Before you make a measurement you tell Einstein what measurement you expect to observe. If you are right Einstein gives you \$100. If you are wrong Einstein zaps you with his many-worlds invention. Do you agree to play Einstein's game? Why or why not? \LeaveSpace{}
    \item (25 points) Consider the quantum states
        \[\ket{+y} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0} + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}\]
        and
        \[\ket{-y} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0} - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}\]
        What quantum gate (unitary matrix) $U$ produces those states given the input qubits $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, respectively?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Define $U$. \LeaveSpace[0.75in]
            \item Prove $U$ is unitary. \LeaveSpace[2.5in]
            \item Write $U$ as the outer product of $\ket{0}$, $\ket{1}$, $\ket{+y}$, and $\ket{-y}$. \LeaveSpace{}
            \item Show that $\ket{+y}$ and $\ket{-y}$ are eigenstates of the Pauli $\mathbf{Y}$ gate. \LeaveSpace{}
            \item More generally, what do the columns of such a 2 Ã— 2 matrix (such as $U$) represent with respect to their inputs in the standard basis ($\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$)? \LeaveSpace{}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item (Bonus, up to 3 points) Write one interesting question related to the content of this homework, and indicate the correct answer. The question can be multiple-choice or free-response.  Interesting questions get credit here;  sufficiently good questions might appear on an exam.
