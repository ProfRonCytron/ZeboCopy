\assignment{Problem Set 3}

\noindent Name:\NameBlank{}  Student ID:\NameBlank{} \newline
\textbf{Note:} You may discuss these problems with other students, but you must write your own solutions. If you run out of space for any question, please use the additional page and clearly indicate which question you are answering.  \textbf{Also feel free to use Matlab to obtain your answers.}
\begin{quote}
    As for all written assignments, you must complete the work on these pages, and upload your completed pages to GradeScope.  Do not simply submit a page with the answers, as we cannot grade your work that way.  GradeScope will allow you to submit separate images for reach response, but it's on you to submit those properly.

    Work submitted improperly will receive no credit.

\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries]
    \item (3 points) What is an operation we often use in our circuits that is \underline{not} unitary? \Blank{}
    \item \[\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{single-q}\]
    (5 points) Describe the above circuit as a single unitary matrix. Show your work. \LeaveSpace{}
    \item \[\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{double-q}\]
    (5 points) Describe the above circuit as a single unitary matrix. Show your work. \LeaveSpace[3.0in]
    \item (3 points) Why would we ever want to consider the tensor product of two gates? \LeaveSpace{}
    \item (5 points) Write the below state as the tensor product of two qubits or prove it is an entangled state.
    \[\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{00} - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{01}\]
    \LeaveSpace[2.0in]
    \item (5 points) Write the below state as the tensor product of two qubits or prove it is an entangled state.
    \[\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{01} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{10}\]
    \LeaveSpace[2.0in] \newpage
    \item (6 points) Give the statevector of each qubit system.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\ket{10}$ \LeaveSpace[0.3in]
            \item $\ket{0+}$ \LeaveSpace[0.3in]
            \item $\ket{+-}$ \LeaveSpace[0.3in]
        \end{enumerate}
    \item (12 points) Give the parameters ($\theta,\phi,\lambda$) needed for the U gate to specify:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item the Pauli X gate? \LeaveSpace[0.3in]
            \item the Pauli Y gate? \LeaveSpace[0.3in]
            \item the Pauli Z gate? \LeaveSpace[0.3in]
            \item the Hadamard gate? \LeaveSpace[0.3in]
        \end{enumerate}
    \item (8 points) Consider the controlled-Y (CY) gate whose behavior is as follows: if the control bit is 0 it does nothing, if the control bit is 1 it applies the Pauli Y gate to the target bit. Give the matrix that describes the CY gate. Could we use this gate to create entanglement? Why or why not? \LeaveSpace[2.5in]
    \item (10 points) Show the below equality is true.
    \[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{01} - \ket{10}) \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{+-} - \ket{-+})\]
    Recall $\equiv$ denotes equivalent up to a global phase. \LeaveSpace[2.0in]
    \item (Bonus, up to 3 points) Write one interesting question related to the content of this homework, and indicate the correct answer. The question can be multiple-choice or free-response.  Interesting questions get credit here;  sufficiently good questions might appear on an exam.
