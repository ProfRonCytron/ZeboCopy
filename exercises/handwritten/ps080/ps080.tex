\begin{quote}
    As for all written assignments, you must upload your completed work to GradeScope.

    You are welcome to work collaboratively on solving these problems, but you each must write or type out your own solution, and upload that to GradeScope.

    Work submitted improperly will receive no credit.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}\bf
You are encouraged to use Matlab to help solve these problems or to check your solutions.  Where you are asked to show your work, you can paste the Matlab output.
