\begin{quote}
    As for all written assignments, you must complete the work on these pages, and upload your completed pages to GradeScope.  Do not simply submit a page with the answers, as we cannot grade your work that way.  GradeScope will allow you to submit separate images for reach response, but it's on you to submit those properly.

    Work submitted improperly will receive no credit.
