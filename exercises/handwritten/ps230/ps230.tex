    As for all written assignments, you must upload your completed work to GradeScope.

    You are welcome to work collaboratively on solving these problems, but you each must write or type out your own solution, and upload that to GradeScope.

    Work submitted improperly will receive no credit.

You are welcome to use Matlab to help solve these problems or to check your solutions.  Where you are asked to show your work, you can paste the Matlab output.

\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries]
    \item\Points{25} Consider Deutsch's problem (Slide Deck~210), where $f(x)$ takes in only a single bit.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\theenumi.\arabic*]
        \item Remembering that global phases can be ignored, what is the state of the \emph{bottom} qubit on output, which originally went unmeasured?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In the balanced case \Blank{}
            \item In the constant case
            \Blank{}
        \end{itemize}
        \item If that bottom qubit is measured in the computational basis, what are the possible outcome(s)? \Blank{}
        \item If that bottom qubit is first passed through a Hadamard gate and then measured in the computational basis, what are the possible outcome(s)?\Blank{}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item\Points{25} Recall the phase-kickback effect covered in Slide Deck 220.  Recall that the oracle box accepts $x$ (of $n$ qubits) and $y$ (a single qubit), and produces on its output:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $x$ copied from left to right taking the top $n$ qubit, and
        \item $\Xor{y}{f(x)}$ using the bottom qubit on which $y$ was presented.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\theenumi.\arabic*]
        \item Below, sketch the quantum circuit below that realizes an oracle with the function $f(x)$ as defined in this table:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{c|c}
                 $\ket{x}$&$f(\ket{x})$  \\\hline
                 $\ket{00}$ & 0 \\
                 $\ket{01}$ & 1 \\
                 $\ket{10}$ & 1 \\
                 $\ket{11}$ & 1 \\
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        Remember that the bottom qubit must be \Xor{y}{f(x)} and not just $f(x)$.
        The fewer gates you use while having a correct answer, the more credit you will receive.
        \LeaveSpace{}
        \item Under the phase-kickback situation, where the qubits $x$ are in a uniform superposition of all possible values, and $\ket{-}$ is presented on the $y$ qubit, what is the output state of the entire circuit (including $y$)?  The simpler your correct answer, the more credit you will receive.
        \LeaveSpace{}
    \end{enumerate}
     \item\Points{30} Consider the Deutsch--Jozsa problem, covered in Slide Deck 230. In that problem, we were \emph{promised} that functions were either constant or balanced. We will now investigate what happens when the promise is broken.  For an $n$-bit problem, recall the amplitude on the $\ket{0^{\star n}}$ term is:
     \[
       \frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{x\in \{0,1\}^{n}} -1^{(f(x))}
     \]
     So let's define
         \[
       k = \left|\frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{x\in \{0,1\}^{n}} -1^{(f(x))}\right|
     \]
     We then obtain:
     \begin{description}
         \item[k=0] Then $f(x)$ is balanced
         \item[k=1] Then $f(x)$ is constant
     \end{description}
     What about other values of $k$?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\theenumi.\arabic*]
        \item Let's start with an example for $n = 2$ qubits:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{c|c}
                 $\ket{x}$&$f(\ket{x})$  \\\hline
                 $\ket{00}$ & 0 \\
                 $\ket{01}$ & 1 \\
                 $\ket{10}$ & 1 \\
                 $\ket{11}$ & 1 \\
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        What is $k$ for this example?\Blank{}
        \item At state~$\psi_{3}$, what amplitude is present on
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\ket{00}$\Blank{}
             \item $\ket{01}$\Blank{}
              \item $\ket{10}$\Blank{}
               \item $\ket{11}$\Blank{}
        \end{itemize}
        \item What is the probability of seeing $\ket{00}$ on the first measurement?\Blank{}
        \item What is the probability of \emph{not} seeing $\ket{00}$ on the first measurement?\Blank{}
        \item Suppose on your first measurement you observe $\ket{01}$.  So you believe the function is balanced.  For this running example, how many more runs of the circuit must you make to be 90\% certain that $f(x)$ is keeping its promise? \Blank{}
