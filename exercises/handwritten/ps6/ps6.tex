\textbf{Note:} You may discuss these problems with other students, but you must write your own solutions. If you run out of space for any question, please use the additional page and clearly indicate which question you are answering.

\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries]

    \item Note: Phase kickback, oracle, Deutsch questions, Deutsch Josza questions
    \item Consider the standard Deutsch problem (Lecture 21).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Remembering that global phases can be ignored, what is the state of the \emph{bottom} qubit, which originally went unmeasured? Be sure to analyze both the balanced and constant case.
        \item What would measure this qubit directly yield?
        \item If the bottom qubit were run through a Hadamard gate, what would measuring it yield?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Consider the phase kickback trick studied in Lecture 22. Suppose the input for $y = \ket{+}$. Explain why the phase kickback trick no longer works by analysing the circuit in terms of the Deutsch problem as well as more generally.
    \item Consider the Deutsch-Josza problem. In this problem, we considered functions that were constant or balanced. We will now investigate how the D-J problem handles a function that isn't balanced or constant. Define a $k$-balanced function to be a function such that $|\sum_{w\in\{0,1\}^n} \mathbbm{1}{[f(w) = 0]} - \sum_{w\in\{0,1\}^n} \mathbbm{1}{[f(w) = 1]}| = k$ (|num of inputs that map to 0 - num of inputs that map to 1| = k). Should probably divide by some function of n.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let's start with an example. Suppose $n = 2$ and $f(\ket{00}) = 0, f(\ket{01}) = 1, f(\ket{10}) = 1, f(\ket{11}) = 1$. Is $f$ $k$-balanced? If so, what is $k$?
        \item Find $\ket{\psi_2}$ of the D-J problem using this $f$.
        \item Find $\ket{\psi_3}$ of the D-J problem using this $f$.
        \item Conclusions?
        \item Move to general case?
        \item How many queries classically would it take to identify if $f$ is constant or $k$-balanced? (balanced or $k$-balanced?)
    \end{enumerate}
    \item (Bonus, up to 3 points) Write one interesting question related to the content of this homework, and indicate the correct answer. The question can be multiple-choice or free-response.  Interesting questions get credit here;  sufficiently good questions might appear on an exam.
\end{enumerate}
