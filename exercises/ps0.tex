\noindent \textbf{Note:} This is intended as a set of review exercises for the class. You should be at least familiar with these types of problems and the concepts used to solve them.

\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries]
    \item Is $x^3$ a reversible function?
    \item Is taking the maximum of some set a reversible function?
    \item Is SHA256 a reversible function? Read about SHA256 here: \newline https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2
    \item What quadrant of the complex unit circle is $e^{i\frac{3\pi}{4}}$ in?
    \item How many different states is it possible for a single qubit to be in?
    \item How many different states is it possible for a single qubit to measure in?
    \item If $a = \begin{pmatrix}5 \\ i \end{pmatrix}$ and $b = \begin{pmatrix}2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$, what is $\braket{a|b}$?
    \item Other linear algebra questions with Dirac notation?
    \item A few more here...
    
\end{enumerate}
