\noindent \textbf{Note}: You must activate the course Conda environment for these steps to work.

\subsection*{Create Assignment}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries]
    \item Create a homework assignment on Gradescope (Create assignment, programming assignment). Enable anonymous and manual grading. Fill in the autograder value specified by the corresponding grading document. Configure other settings as desired.
    \item Obtain a token
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Open a Python shell
        \item Run \texttt{from otter.generate.token import APIClient}
        \item Run \texttt{print(APIClient.get\_token())}. You will be prompted for your Gradescope email and password.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Clone sample.ipynb to create a master assignment \texttt{q*.ipynb}. Fill in the token, course\_id, and assignment\_id fields. The course\_id and assignment\_id can be obtained by clicking into an assignment on Gradescope and inspecting the URL.
    For example,\\ \texttt{www.gradescope.com/courses/280928/assignments/1733086/outline/edit} shows that the course\_id is 280928 and assignment\_id is 1733086.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Build and Distribute Assignment}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries]
    \item Copy the master assignment file, \texttt{q*.ipynb}, to a dedicated directory and \texttt{cd} to that directory.
    \item Run all cells of the \texttt{q*.ipynb} and save.
    \item Run \texttt{otter assign q*.ipynb q*-dist --v1}. You may get a number of warnings for otter syntax errors which will need to be fixed before the assignment can be generated. If everything goes smoothly, the command will print ``All tests passed!" at the end.
    \item \texttt{cd} into \texttt{dist}. Note the respective \texttt{autograder} and \texttt{student} directories.
    \item \texttt{cd} into \texttt{autograder}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Configure additional manual graded questions with their point values.
        \item Add \texttt{autograder.zip} to the configure autograder section of the Gradescope assignment. The Dockerfile will take a bit to build.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
