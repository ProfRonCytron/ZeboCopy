\begin{frame}{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur-Vaidman_bomb_tester}{Elitzur--Vaidman} bomb is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment}{Gedankenexperiment} in which a photon measured in a certain way triggers an explosion.
    \item We can devise a quantum algorithm that is arbitrarily likely to detect the presence of such a bomb without setting it off.
    \item This algorithm captures the flow of most quantum algorithms:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Preparation of a known state
        \item Transformation of state by quantum gates
        \item Iteration by passes or unrolling of a circuit
        \item Measurement to obtain the result
        \item Probabilistic analysis for correctness
    \end{itemize}
    \item The algorithm uses an interferometer setup like the one we have studied.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{How good is this approach?}{Some analysis}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the bomb is there, we are successful 25\% of the time in finding that it is there without blowing up.
    \item If the bomb is not there, we do not gain anything  useful information because all photons are measured by the \textcolor{orange}{orange sensor}.
    \item After many tries, we can claim with some probability that there is no bomb present.  The probability that we measure $n$ successve photons at the \textcolor{orange}{orange device} with a bomb present is $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{n}$.
    \item Our belief that there is no bomb thus grows exponentially in the number of photons that continue to be observed at the \textcolor{orange}{orange sensor}.
