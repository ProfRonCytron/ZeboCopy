\begin{frame}{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur-Vaidman_bomb_tester}{Elitzur--Vaidman} bomb is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment}{Gedankenexperiment} in which a photon measure in a certain way triggers an explosion.
    \item We can devise a quantum algorithm that is arbitrarily likely to detect the presence of such a bomb without setting it off.
    \item This algorithm captures the flow of most quantum algorithms:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Preparation of a known state
        \item Transformation of state by quantum gates
        \item Iteration by passes or unrolling of a circuit
        \item Measurement to obtain the result
        \item Probabilistic analysis for correctness
    \end{itemize}
    \item The algorithm uses an interferometer setup like the one we have studied.
\end{itemize}
