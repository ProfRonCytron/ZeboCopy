\begin{frame}{Universality}{Some initial thoughts}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item We captured the essence of a single qubit using two real rotational parameters $\phi$ and $\theta$.  Those parameters describe points on the unit sphere, each point corresponding to a quantum state.
    \item A quantum gate is a mapping from states to states.
    \item Because such gates must have inverses, the mapping established by such gates must be \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection}{bijective}.
    \item We can think of a gate as a permutation of states, or points on the Bloch sphere.
    \item How many parameters does it take to characterize an arbitrary single-qubit quantum gate?
\end{itemize}
