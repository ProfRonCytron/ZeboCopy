000 put in slides about the questions math and logic can answer:
   entanglement
   promiscuity
   monogamy
   teleportation
   problems q can solve
090 Slide 19
100 Slide 10 

110 Show that with 3-way entanglement (GHZ state), Eve's and Bob's qubits do not follow Alice's under H to measure in X.

Where to put in entanglement in any basis persists for two-way


130, slide 15, not really a mess but fix if needed
220 Slide 8 -- prove the X basis expression
  and show that in the X measurement basis on the bloch sphere we can figure
  out the angle!
