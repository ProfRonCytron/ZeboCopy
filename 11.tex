\OnlyRemark{8}{%
It's easy to compute $A$ from $a$ and $B$ from $b$.  There is no known \emph{efficient} classical algorithm for computing $a$ given $A$ and $B$.  Alice and Bob share the key and nobody else can compute it efficiently unless they know $a$ or $b$---unless they have a sufficiently large quantum computer.

\begin{frame}{Remarks on Diffie--Hellman}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item The inventors were recognized in 2015 with the \href{https://awards.acm.org/about/2015-turing}{Turing award}.
    \item The shared secret is used sufficiently briefly that attempts to guess it will not pay off.
    \item The secrets $a$ and $b$ can be randomly generated.
    \item Eve, the evesdropper, can determine $a$ and $b$ if she can efficiently solve the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm}{discrete log} problem.
    \item A quantum computer can do that!
    \item Most companies are therefore interested in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography}{post-quantum cryptography}.
