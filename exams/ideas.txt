You are given a source of photons, and promised that they are all
either 
type A: polarized at 45 degrees or 
type B: unpolarized.

If you know they are all polarized at 45 degrees, what is the state
of each photon relative to |0> horizontal and |1> vertical polarization?

If you know the are all unpolarized, what is the stat of each photon
relative to |0> horizontal and |1> vertical?

Given as many photons as you need from the source, devise an experiment to
tell whether the source is emitting type A or type B photons.
