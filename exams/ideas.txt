You are given a source of photons, and promised that they are all
either 
type A: polarized at 45 degrees or 
type B: unpolarized.

If you know they are all polarized at 45 degrees, what is the state
of each photon relative to |0> horizontal and |1> vertical polarization?

If you know the are all unpolarized, what is the stat of each photon
relative to |0> horizontal and |1> vertical?

Given as many photons as you need from the source, devise an experiment to
tell whether the source is emitting type A or type B photons.

Give the state |psi> and its antipodal state |psi'> as defined in hw 060, 
  what is |psipsi>
  what is |psi'psi'>
what is 1/root(2)  |psipsi> + |psi'psi'>
noting that cos(pi/2 - x) = sin(x) and sin(pi/2 - x) = cos(x)

What measurements are possible and how is this related to the (common) Bell state?


What state would you need so that no phone call is necessary from Alice to Bob
to teleport.  Why is such a state infeasible/
