\begin{assignment}{Exam I}{9 March 2022}{End of class}

{\small {\large \fbox{READ THIS before starting!}}
This exam is open-book, open-notes, open-Internet, but you must do this
work on your own without contact or conversations with any person.
Because this exam is given in a somewhat distributed manner, no questions will be answered, and no clarifications will be given.  State your assumptions and count on us to be fair and flexible, especially if we have been unclear.


Your work must be legible.  Work that is
difficult to read will receive no credit.  There is a blank page at the end
if you want to show extra work there.

There are 118 points available for this exam, but it will only be scored out of 100.  Extra points earned here will count toward your total exam grade, including Exam~II.

You must sign the pledge below for your exam to count.  Any cheating will
cause the students involved to receive an F for this course. Other unpleasant
actions
may be taken.

You must fill in your identifying information correctly.

\clearpage\item\Points{10}
Consider the following entangled state of three qubits:
\[\frac{\ket{000}+\ket{111}}{\sqrt{2}}\]
In lecture we studied how to entangle that third qubit with the first two.  In this problem we consider \emph{disentangling} the third qubit from the first two, without resorting to measurement.

Recall that we entangle the third new qubit $q_{3}$ with those that came before ($q_{1}, q_{2}$) using a \Gate{CNOT} gate, controlled by either $q_{1}$ or $q_{2}$, and applied to $q_{3}$ which is initialized to~\ket{0}.  Because \Gate{CNOT} is its own inverse, we try using the gate again to disentangle~$q_{3}$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item\Points{2} 
  \[(\I\otimes\Gate{CNOT})(\ket{000}) = \Blanket{}\]
\item\Points{2} 
  \[(\I\otimes\Gate{CNOT})(\ket{111} = \Blanket{}\]
\item \Points{3} By linearity,
\[(\I\otimes\Gate{CNOT})\left(\frac{\ket{000}+\ket{111}}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{\Blank[4em]+\Blank[4em]}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\ket{00}+\ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}} \otimes \Blanket{}\]
\item \Points{2} Qubit $q_3$ is now disentangled and in its current state it measures as~$\Blanket{}$.
\item \Points{1} Measuring $q_3$ causes collapse of the other two qubits? \TF{}
