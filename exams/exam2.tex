This exam is open-book, open-notes, open-Internet, but you must do this
work on your own without contact or conversations with any person.
Because this exam is given in a somewhat distributed manner, no questions will be answered, and no clarifications will be given.  State your assumptions and count on us to be fair and flexible, especially if we have been unclear.


Your work must be legible.  Work that is
difficult to read will receive no credit.  There is a blank page at the end
if you want to show extra work there.

There are 116 points available for this exam, but it will only be scored out of 100.  Extra points earned here will count toward your total exam grade.

You must sign the pledge below for your exam to count.  Any cheating will
cause the students involved to receive an F for this course. Other unpleasant
actions
may be taken.

\TFMarked{\textbf{x}}{\relax} or \TFMarked{\relax}{\textbf{x}}.  

Each response is worth 3 points and there are 6 points of extra credit available here.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deutsch--Jozsa solves a problem in polynomial time on a quantum computer that takes worst-case exponential time on a classical computer.~\TF{}
    \item With a single query, a classical computer has at least a 50\% chance of determining the correct solution to a Deutsch--Jozsa problem.~\TF{}
    \item An $n$-bit instance of Bernstein--Vazirani can take $\Theta(2^{n})$ time on a classical computer to solve exactly.~\TF{}
    \item An $n$-bit instance of Simon's problem can take $\Theta(2^{n})$ time on a classical computer to solve exactly.~\TF{}
    \item If the Deutsch--Jozsa quantum algorithm is presented with an oracle from Bernstein--Vazirani with secret $s$, then the circuit's measurements will yield a unique result (depends only on $s$) in the computational basis.~\TF{}
    \item If the entangled qubits for the CHSH game fail (they decohere and collapse into random values), Alice and Bob can at best win 75\% of the time.~\TF{}
    \item In the Mermin--Peres square, each of Alice's qubits is entangled with one of Bob's qubits.  If that entanglement did not exist, the values Alice reports for her assigned rows still multiply to $+1$, as they should.~\TF{}
    \item In the Mermin--Peres square, each of Alice's qubits is entangled with one of Bob's qubits.  If that entanglement did not exist, Alice and Bob would still agree on the value of their shared square, as they should.~\TF{}

\item\Points{2} With this change to Mermin--Peres, answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For any of her three rows, Alice \emph{always} reports values whose products are $+1$ as required.~\TF{}

\begin{itemize}
\item Recall that in the CHSH solution, the angle between adjacent rays in the picture above is $\pi/8$, so that the probability of agreement where it should happen is approximately~$85\%$.
\item Suppose the angle between each adjacent pair of rays is changed to $\pi/16$, so that when they should agree, their probability of agreement is now
\[ \cos^{2}(\pi/16) \approx 96\% \]

All other aspects of the game are unchanged:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Alice and Bob are provided colors that are chosen randomly and uniformly.
    \item The metric for success of the game is the \emph{average} rate at which Alice and Bob agree when they should, and disagree when they should, over all 4 possible combinations of colors they can be provided. 
    \item In the game's solution using the above diagram, as taught, the success metric is approximately~85\%.

Answer the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item\Points{1} This change improves the success of the game.~\TF{}.

\end{itemize}

\clearpage\item\Points{10}

During an iteration of Grover, and after the first step (reflection) but before the second step (diffusion), we have obtained the following state:
\[
\ket{\psi_{f}} \approx \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
   0.35 \\
   0.35 \\
   0.35 \\
   0.35 \\
   0.35 \\
   -0.35 \\
   0.35 \\
   0.35
\end{pmatrix*}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item This is an instance of Grover for a function, where the input values are \Blank{} bits wide.
    \item From $\ket{\psi_{f}}$ what is the secret \ket{w} (the input value that is special here)?\Blank{}
    \item This is the first step of the \Blank{} iteration of the algorithm.
    \item When we complete this iteration by performing diffusion, the amplitude on \ket{w} will be approximately \Blank{}, because it increases each iteration by~\Blank{}.
    
    
\end{enumerate}

\clearpage\item\Points{5} You are at a party where everybody is talking about quantum computing.  You overhear somebody pontificating about Bernstein--Vazirani problems of $n$ bits, namely functions of the form
\( f(x) = x \cdot s \),
where $x$ and $s$ are each $n$ bits wide.  

After one too many Negronis, the person claims that \emph{all} values of $s$ lead to balanced functions for the Deutsch--Jozsa problem.

Not so fast, you say.  That is almost true.  Yes, in terms of $n$ there are $\Theta\left(\mbox{\vrule width 0pt height 2em depth 0pt\raisebox{-1.5em}{\Blank[2.2em]}}\right)$ such functions, but for one value of $s$, namely $s=\Blank{}$, $f(x)=x\cdot s$ is not a balanced function; it is, in fact, constant.

OK the pontificator concedes, you are right\footnote{At least, Cytron hopes you got this right; sadly, he was not invited to this party}, but for all other values of $s$, the Bernstein--Vazirani functions provide \emph{all} oracles that are balanced to Deutsch--Jozsa: there are no others.

Thundering superpositions, you exclaim, that cannot be the case.  And you continue by providing a single-qubit example\footnote{the crowd gasping in awe at the elegance and simplicity of your counterexample} of a function that is balanced, but not of the form $f(x)=x\cdot s$ for any $s$:
\begin{align*}
    f(0) &= \Blank{} \\
    f(1) &= \Blank{}
\end{align*}
You then draw the oracle for this function on a conveniently provided napkin (just draw gates as needed over what you see below):

\begin{center}
\adjustbox{valign=t,scale=2.0}{\begin{quantikz}
\lstick{$x$} &  \qw & \qw & \qw & \qw & \rstick{$x$}\\[1.5em]
\lstick{$y$} &  \qw & \qw & \qw & \qw & \rstick{$y\oplus f(x)$}\\
\end{quantikz}}\end{center}

Be certain your oracle provides both of the outputs as required and shown above.




\clearpage\item\Points{10} For each question below, fill in the blank.  Your answer must appear in the provided blank for proper credit.  Write each response in the provided blank space, fully above the dark line.  For example, to express $\frac{i}{\sqrt{3}}$ you would write \Blank{}\hbox to 0pt{\hskip -4em\raisebox{4pt}{$i/\sqrt{3}$}\hss}.  


\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider the oracle portion of a circuit below for an $8$-bit instance of the Bernstein--Vazirani problem.  Recall the oracle computes $y=x\oplus s$ for a secret bit vector~$s$.
    
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{bv.png}
    
    What is the secret $s$ here? \Blank[2in]{}
    \item If this oracle is used in the Deutsch--Jozsa algorithm, what possible amplitude(s) can be measured on $\ket{00000000}$?
    
    \Blank[4in]{}
    \item What other computational basis vector(s), if any, will have non-zero amplitude for Deutsch--Jozsa if the above oracle is used?  
    
    \Blank[4in]{}
\end{itemize}

\clearpage\item\Points{10}
Complete the circuit below so that it is an oracle for Grover's algorithm on a 5-qubit instance, sending $\ket{xy}$ to $\ket{x\ \  y\oplus f(x)}$ where the secret is $10101$.  Below you provide only the oracle, not any other portions of the circuit.

\end{quantikz}}

\item\Points{5}
Consider a 2-qubit instance of Grover with the secret value $\ket{00}$.  The circuit up to the point of the diffusion step is specified.  Complete the circuit by adding the diffusion (also called reflection about $\ket{s}$) step.

\adjustbox{valign=t,scale=1.3}{\begin{quantikz}
\lstick{$\ket{0}$} & \qw      &  \gate{H} & \gate{X} & \ctrl{2} & \gate{X} & \qw

\end{quantikz}}

\clearpage\item\Points{10} (1 per blank)
Recall for Grover's problem that when an oracle provided a single secret, we obtained $\ket{w}$ as a column vector of all zeros, but with a 1 in the location of the secret.   For example, for a two-qubit problem ($N=4$) with secret $\ket{00}$ 
\[ \ket{w} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{pmatrix} \]
Suppose the oracle instead provides \emph{two} secret values, $\ket{00}$ and $\ket{11}$.  If Grover's algorithm could reach $\ket{w}$ and we performed a measurement of $\ket{w}$ we would be satisfied at measuring \emph{either} secret ($\ket{00}$ or $\ket{11}$).

We begin as before with
\[ \ket{s} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix} \]

But for this problem with the two secret values $\ket{00}$ and $\ket{11}$ (fill in the blanks):
\[ \ket{w} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} \Blank[2em]{} \\ \Blank[2em]{} \\\Blank[2em]{} \\\Blank[2em]{} \end{pmatrix} \]
and thus $\ket{s'}$ which must be orthogonal to $\ket{w}$ is (fill in the blanks):
\[ s' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} \Blank[2em]{} \\ \Blank[2em]{} \\\Blank[2em]{} \\\Blank[2em]{} \end{pmatrix} \]
The inner product of $\ket{s}$ and $\ket{s'}$ is then
\( \braket{s}{s'} = \frac{\Blank[2em]{}}{\sqrt{4}} \) (fill in the numerator)

Generally, for an $n$~qubit instance of Grover ($N=2^n$), where $\ket{w}$ represents $k$ acceptable secret values, what is the inner product of the resulting $\ket{s}$ and $\ket{s'}$? $\frac{\Blank[2em]{}}{\sqrt{N}}$

\Points{5}Complete the circuit below so that it is an oracle for Grover's algorithm on a 2-qubit instance, sending $\ket{xy}$ to $\ket{x\ \  y\oplus f(x)}$ where the secret value is either $00$ or $11$.  Below you provide only the oracle, not any other portions of the circuit.

\adjustbox{valign=t,scale=3.0}{\begin{quantikz}
\lstick{$x_1$} &  \qw & \qw & \qw & \qw & \qw\\
\lstick{$x_2$} &  \qw & \qw & \qw & \qw & \qw\\
\lstick{$y$} &  \qw & \qw & \qw & \qw & \qw\\
\end{quantikz}}


\clearpage\item\Points{5} Using Shor's algorithm, let's try to factor the number~35 using the following table of values for
\[ 2^{i} \mbox{ mod 35} \]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
  $i$ & $2^{i}\mbox{ mod 35}$ \\\hline
  0 & 1 \\

8 & 11 \\
9 &  22 \\
10 &  9 \\
11 & 18 \\
12 &  1
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the period of this function?\Blank{}
    \item $2$ is a suitable base for using Shor's algorithm to factor~35 because the period of $2^{i}\mbox{ mod 35}$ is even~\TF{}.
    \item To find the factors of 35 we would perform the following computations:
    
     GCD(\Blank[3em]{},35) = \Blank[3em]{}
        
        and 
        
        GCD(\Blank[3em]{},35) = \Blank[3em]{}
