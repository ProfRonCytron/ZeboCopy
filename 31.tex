\SetTitle{31}{The Quantum Fourier Transform}{Phase estimation in reverse}{31}

\begin{frame}{Overview}{What will we study?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform}{Fourier Transform} is well known in physics and mathematics for its ability to represent a time-based signal as a summation of frequencies that approximates or yields the original signal.
    \item We will review the basics of the classical Fourier transform.
    \item We will study the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), but it turns out that this circuit is simply the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_phase_estimation_algorithm}{Phase Estimation} circuit, executed in reverse.
    \item The QFT is at the center of important quantum algorithms, such as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor\%27s_algorithm}{Shor's Algorithm}, which we study next.
