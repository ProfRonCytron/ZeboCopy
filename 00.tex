\begin{frame}{Some notes about these slides}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item These slides were prepared during my sabbatical leave.  I am grateful to Washington University, McKelvey School of Engineering, and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for sponsoring my sabbatical.
    \item There are some typographical conventions used in these slides, as follows.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These slides include \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink}{hyperlinks} to material you can find on the Internet.
        \item Where a larger idea or presentation cites material on the Internet, that link will often appear before or after the material. \LinkArrow{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources}
        \item Where images appear without citation, they are available for \emph{free use} or fall under the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use}{\emph{fair use}} clause for copyright material. \LinkArrow{https://fas.org/irp/crs/RL31423.pdf}

\begin{quote}
    If a husband says something, but his wife is not around to hear it, is he still wrong? --- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Wright}{Steven Wright}
\end{quote}
In love and appreciation, I dedicate this work to my wife, Betsy Cytron.  At this writing we have been married~32 years, and she has been with me through good times and bad. We have watched and helped each other find happiness and satisfaction in our work, in our families, and in each other.  I am grateful and so fortunate to have such a partner in life.
\SmallSkip{}
From some thesaurus, which I have thus far been unable to locate,  Betsy holds that \href{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sabbatical}{sabbatical} is a synonym for vacation.  My time has been wonderfully flexible in sabbatical, and I am grateful to Betsy for understanding that sabbatical involves work, just of a different pace and nature.

\begin{frame}{Errata}

This work no doubt has errors, and that's on me, the quote on the previous slide notwithstanding.  If you find a mistake please write \href{mailto:cytron@wustl.edu}{cytron@wustl.edu} so I can make corrections to this material.

Thanks for your help!

\begin{frame}{Colophon}{Tools rule}
Before I embarked on this journey, my extensive research (asking friends and colleagues on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook}{facebook}) identified \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)}{beamer} as the package of choice for generating slides using \href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX}{\LaTeX}.

\begin{description}[<+->]
  \item[beamer] allows slides to be designed to include overlays to reveal information and develop a story, without having to specify the same material repeatedly. As is typically the case with this style of authoring material, I was able to focus primarily on the content, leaving issues of formatting and display to the tools.
  \item[\href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/PGF/TikZ}{tikz}] is a powerful package for typesetting drawings.
  \item[\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/quantikz?lang=en}{quantikz}] is a package for typesetting quantum circuits.
\end{description}
I wrote many macros in \TeX{} and \LaTeX{}, which I will gladly share, but without the above tools, this work would have been unnecessarily difficult.  Many thanks to those who have developed these tools.

\begin{frame}{Prerequisites}
\begin{description}[<+->]
    \item[Matrix math]  We use matrix and linear algebra heavily.  You should be familiar with row and column vectors, matrix multiplication, linear systems of equations, eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
    
    Examples:  Math 309, En Math
    \item[Probability] Quantum computations are inherently probabilistic.  You need to have some background in probability, but it doesn't have to be extensive.  The probability we use is fairly simple and intuitive.
    
    Examples:  ESE 326 or Math 3200
    \item[Circuits]  We will introduce and study quantum computations using circuit diagrams.    Some familiarity with Boolean algebra and logic is needed.
    
    Examples:  CSE 240, CSE 132, or CSE 260M
